# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame.

## Description

This project implements the classic Snake Game using Pygame, a popular library for game development in Python. The player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items while avoiding collision with itself or the game boundaries. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by guiding the snake to eat as much food as possible without crashing into obstacles.
